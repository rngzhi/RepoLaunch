## Contributing Suggestions

1. Welcome issues and PRs related to the bugs and inefficiencies of out agent.

2. We found that many threads created from launch/run.py would have "Result Empty Error", which means the last agent state is not saved to disk and not passed back to the main function in launch/run.py. But we failed to find any problems in our code. Maybe it is the problem of concurrency, the problem of old Langchain agent apis... Please help us find that problem and fix it!

3. In [launch/utilities/language_handlers.py](launch/utilities/language_handlers.py), you can see language-specific and operating-system-specific prompts and base images. 
Please help us improve these prompts and add new base images. 
Base images need update when the latest version of a language updates. 
Please add official new images if official sources provide them; 
otherwise you could help us build customized ones and upload to dockerhub public repos, there are example dockerfiles in [launch/utilities/dockerfiles](launch/utilities/dockerfiles).

4. To improve the success rate / lower down early submit hallucination (unsuccessful build but submit) in the setup stage; 
and increase the extraction coverage of per-testcase status and per-testcase command from test log in the organize stage -- any suggestions and improvements to the agent workflow is welcome.
